When you realize you should be keeping a spreadsheet to avoid embarrassing duplicate applications to the same job, and then you realize that you should actually make an application tracking application, complete with tests and a front end.

(but really, I'm going to try learning how to make a web application front end, and having a simple back end already built and tested will be handy)

- Added an API method to load test data, so it's less messy than editing the main method.
- Added Open API/Swagger UI documentation.
- Added unit testing for the repository and service layers.
- Added unit testing for the controller layer.
- Added integration testing.
  - Discovered testing is really fickle and tempermental

Spring Boot, Maven, MySQL.  Tests with JUnit and Mockito.
